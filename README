blender-scripts:
================

  a dump of random scripts made for use in Blender.
  not qualifiable to be full standalone plugins, so
  they need to be executed manually via the Blender
  built-in script editor.

rand_rect.py:
-------------

  generates a randomly-subdivided plane where each
  polygon is also extruded at a random height.
